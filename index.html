        <h2 id="heading">The Illegitimate Child</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">Trevor Noah is considered an illegitimate child because he was born to unmarried parents.In the context, it does not refer to the traditional notion of being born from a union that was illegal under the state's racial laws, thereby having to live hidden from the society himself.</p>
          
        <p id="paragraph">"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”
        </p>
        <h3 id="reflective">Personal Reflective</h3>
        <p id="paragraph">Relationships thrive on mutual support and encouragement of individual growth.Partners actively champion each other and celebrate their success without restricting their freedom.Society increasingly value personal development and self recovery ,which can influence how individuals approach marriage ,partners may seek a relationship that supports their personal aspirations and allows for individual growth within the partnership.
            
            Social media portrays idealization of relationships that can be misleading .The independent woman can become a trend without understanding and accepting the challenges that come along in a relationship.The ‘cage’ can be the pressure to the usual standards of behaviours that are expected by the society.

        <p id="paragraph">Traditional gender roles are shifting with women increasingly pursuing careers and maintaining financial independence , which enhances their autonomy within marriage.People get encouraged to pursue personal growth and development which can lead to greater sense of self-reliance within the marital context.Some individuals who express a desire  for an independent might actually fear being truly needed or relied upon.Their attraction to independence could stem from a desire to avoid dependency.</p>

            
        <p id="paragraph">Modern relationship ideas often emphasize mutual respect,open communication and supporting each other’s aspirations .The idea of “cage” a partner is increasingly seen as unhealthy to fulfilling relationships.Society often praises ambition and assertiveness in the men but can view the same qualities in women as aggressive.A man might say he wants a strong woman , but he might be more comfortable if her strength is directed towards supporting his goals rather than pursuing her own with equal fervor.</p>
